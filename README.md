# thesis
This is a code that I wrote during my thesis in C++. It implements the Metropolis algorithm which is applied on a system of interacting nanoparticles to study their magnetic properties and their agglomerate formation in a presence or absence of an external magnetic field. The code has been rewritten many times over the years.
